These instructions are intended to help set up the initial file vault replication on another archive server for an existing vault that already contains large amount of files. 

The processes involves making a 1:1 ”snapshot” copy of the complete original file vault archive using hard drive backup or similar and then synchronize the replication information in the file vault database so that each replicated server has the same archive file content. 

You could for example use it to copy the existing archives to a removable drive and ship it to the remote location to avoid having to replicate all existing files.

Considerations
During the vault archive copy, NO clients may modify or add new files to the file vault.
This method will copy the complete archive, if you just want to replicate bits of the vault you are recommended to set up a replication schedule instead and select the vault folders that should replicate.
It is not possible to use the script if parts of the vault have already been replicated to the new server – if so you need to remove the existing replication and set it up again.
Make a SQL backup of the file vault database before running the SQL script.
It is extremely important that the SQL script is run directly after the archive files have been copied and the files match – no additional changes may be performed by users until the script completes.
This script is only for PDMWorks Enterprise 2008 or newer file vaults.
If the new replicated server is in a remote office and you plan to copy the archives to a removable media and ship it to the remote office – make sure that the SQL script is run directly after the files have been copied.  Once users start making new versions of files in the vault, the copied archives will be out of sync again and if the script was not run, you would have to redo the copy process. 
If you are shipping the media to a remote location, the clients attached to the new replicated server should not work in the vault until the media have arrived and the archive files have been copied over to the new server. If they start working in the vault on the replicated server, mismatches will be introduced.

Scenario
Original archive server A (STOCKHOLM1) has a file vault archive with existing files.
New archive server B (LPT-TOR) should have a replicated synced copy of server A’s files.
